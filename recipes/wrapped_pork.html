    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh sage, leaves removed and stems discarded, divided</li>
        <li>6 ounces prosciutto</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>

    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>

    <p>Lightly season pork with salt and black pepper. Arrange about 6 sage leaves over tenderloin. Wrap prosciutto around tenderloin and sage, overlapping prosciutto slightly; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate to allow prosciutto to set on pork tenderloin, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove plastic wrap.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>

    <p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry wrapped tenderloin in the hot oil until prosciutto is crispy and lightly browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer wrapped tenderloin to a baking dish, reserving oil in the skillet.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>

    <p>Bake tenderloin in the preheated oven until pork is cooked through, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C)</p>
    
    <h3>Step 5</h3>

    <p>Heat reserved oil in the skillet over medium heat; fry remaining sage leaves until crispy, adding more oil as needed, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>

    <p>Slice tenderloin and serve with crispy sage leaves.</p>
