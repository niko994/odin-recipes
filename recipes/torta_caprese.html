    <p>This Italian flourless chocolate torte has a light texture and is firm without being stodgy. Serve with unsweetened whipped cream and tart fresh berries.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces dark chocolate (70% cacao), chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup ground almond meal (also know as almond flour)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coffee liqueur</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>tiny pinch cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>¾ cup white granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>

    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease an 8-inch cake pan with butter, and place a round piece of parchment paper in the bottom. Dust the inside and sides with flour and knock out access. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>

    <p>Place chocolate and butter in a mixing bowl, and place on top of a saucepan filled with 1 inch of water. Place on low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>

    <p>Remove from heat, and stir together with a spatula. Stir in almond meal, cocoa powder, coffee liqueur, salt, and cayenne until fully combined. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>

    <p>Combine eggs and sugar in a second bowl, and beat with an electric mixer, or whisk by hand until very thick and pale colored.</p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>

    <p>Pour chocolate mixture into the egg mixture; fold in gently with a spatula until just combined. Transfer batter into the prepared pan. Tap pan on the counter to settle the mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>

    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden skewer inserted near the center comes out almost clean, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 7</h3>

    <p>Let cool for 30 minutes in the pan before turning out onto a plate. Let cool to room temperature, before wrapping and transferring into the fridge to chill before serving.</p>

    <h3>Step 8</h3>

    <p>Before cutting, the top can be dusted with cocoa and/or powdered sugar if desired. Serve with unsweetened whipped cream and fresh raspberries.</p>
